A version of the classic snake game.

# History
Original development stopped 2015-01-13 (it started in early 2014). Feel free to open a pull request if you want to continue it!

# Compilation
You can compile the `.bas` (FreeBASIC) file with the [freebasic compiler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fbc/files/ "FreeBASIC Compiler on SourceFourge") (last tested with `fbc` version 1.05.0):
```
fbc BSnakeAlt.bas
```

# Known Issues
**LOTS**, here are some:
- Segfault without options given
  - Give both `-noconsole` and `-developer` to make it work!
- The 'head' of the snake will sometimes 'detatch'.

See the notes in `BSnakeAlt.bas` for other known issues.
